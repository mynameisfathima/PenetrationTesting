#### Anatomy of Yaml

```yaml
id: "login page checker"
info:
  name: "See if Login page exist"
  author: "DanBrown47"
  severity: "medium"

requests:

- method: GET
  path:
  - "{{BaseURL}}/login"
- matchers:
  - type: regex
    pattern: "(?i)login"
  - type: status
    status:

    - 200
```

In the above yaml it is expected the application sends a request to baseURL and route login, then it checks if the response hits 200 as well as if the page contains the name "login" which is done by the regex.
